# OpenXR host and controls

## Current source — 2026-10-07

Current game/host IPC is9 and the offline suite has58 groups. A response-owned
head-clearance receipt now limits current head/eye placement and cached-image
age when the default-off head guard is enabled. Game, server and host also carry
read-only exported build-input/version/layout contracts for package verification.
See HEAD_VOLUME_INTEGRATION.md and PACKAGE_IDENTITY.md. All products cross-build;
Windows and Linux/Proton runtime behavior remains untested. The original integration
record below retains historical ABI6 wording and delegation provenance.

## Original host integration record

The final x64 Windows host is implemented in src/host/host.cpp and linked with the official pinned OpenXR loader. No host/runtime/headset execution occurred. Final integration supersedes the worker's initial frozen-header status; source construction and a strict x64 compile were delegated to GPT-6.1 Sol at xhigh, then integrated by the main agent.

The host opens the per-launch IPC channel, checks ABI/size/PID ownership and monitors the game process. It loads the adjacent official loader by absolute filename, resolves APIs through xrGetInstanceProcAddr, enables XR_KHR_D3D11_enable, selects PRIMARY_STEREO/opaque blending, queries adapter LUID/minimum feature level, and creates D3D11 on the runtime-selected adapter. LOCAL and VIEW spaces, independent left/right aim and grip action spaces and a single action set supply actual HMD/controller poses.

READY begins the session, STOPPING ends it, and loss/exit invalidates input and pending work. Reference changes advance a generation at their predicted change time. Lost runtime events fail closed. Every frame uses WaitFrame/BeginFrame/LocateViews/SyncActions and independently publishes the latest finite valid and actively tracked poses/input. Frame guards end failed frames with zero layers. Idle/unfocused controls remain neutral.

ABI6's two owned stereo slots carry immutable sequence/time/session/reference/native-epoch/eye/FOV/input snapshots. Input publishes every XR frame; the host polls completion without waiting for game capture and admits only one pending transaction, including cancelled Rendering and Ready retries. Cancellation never reclaims native Rendering. A complete eligible pair replaces the cached pair before the provisional 150 ms enqueue-age cutoff; its original LOCAL poses/FOV may be reused while lifecycle/focus/tracking/dimension/epoch checks remain valid. A final atomic epoch/age check occurs before EndFrame; invalidation immediately after that check remains a distributed race, not an atomic cross-process submission guarantee.

Both swapchain images must finish acquisition/wait before either upload/release. Timed-out waits retain the existing acquisition and Ready for retry. Reacquiring the last-released image suppresses reuse. Cache is invalidated before replacement and committed only after both releases and a device-health check. A post-wait abandoned candidate releases waited images without writes; this also invalidates cache because the runtime's most-recent released image changes. Outstanding timed-out acquisitions are retried and retired without acquiring additional images. Submitted eye poses/FOV are those used to render, not a later sample. Native BGRA8 CPU pixels upload to BGRA8 UNORM swapchains, or are explicitly converted to RGBA8 UNORM if necessary. sRGB encodings are not guessed.

Wheel quads have separate textures and LOCAL anchors frozen when the native UI opens them. GDI draws stock labels/ammo/highlights into transparent BGRA discs. Selection/deadzones remain game-owned. A level LOCAL-space threshold-follow HUD presents native health/armor/current-hand ammo. Explicitly classified menu/loading frames use a separate level LOCAL-space threshold-follow screen quad; they never become a stereo projection. The game bridge consumes menu controls only while its window is foreground. Controller rays intersect the actual submitted menu quad; a visible ring shows the hit. The native cursor/button dispatcher accepts coordinates and trigger from that presented sample only while its menu generation and exact visual-frame sequence match. Stick/Use/Menu remain available, with duplicate trigger-to-Enter confirmation suppressed during pointer mode. Required composition-layer capacity is four.

COM, Win32, GDI and OpenXR objects have owned teardown. Normal STOPPING invalidates presentation and retires existing acquisitions in every stereo/UI chain before EndSession, with a 500 ms retry bound and host exit on failure. Resize/destruction attempts no-write retirement after GPU drain; an unwaited timed-out image is disposed of by destroying the drained chain, never released illegally. GPU resize/shutdown uses a 500 ms drain; a hung GPU retains graphics/runtime objects until OS teardown instead of destroying in-use resources. Concise errors and five-second accepted/submitted/reused/retired/expired/invalidated/image-wait counters go to a bounded host log. CPU readback/upload and the native renderer are not latency-bounded or runtime-verified.

## Controller bindings

Profile/component paths were checked against pinned Khronos xr.xml. Triggers are independent float actions; sticks/trackpads are vector actions. Touch/Index squeeze values above 0.65 and Vive/Microsoft squeeze clicks open the respective wheel. The runtime may remap or reject profile suggestions; rejected suggestions are logged.

| Profile | Axes | Use | Jump | Menu | Sprint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Oculus Touch | Thumbsticks | X / A | Y / B | Left menu | Either stick click |
| Valve Index | Thumbsticks | Either A | Right B | Left B | Either stick click |
| HTC Vive | Trackpads | Right menu | Right trackpad click | Left menu | Left trackpad click |
| Microsoft Motion | Thumbsticks | Left trackpad click | Right trackpad click | Either menu | Either stick click |

Recenter: both grips plus left stick/trackpad click. That chord suppresses gameplay actions and resets the common origin while retaining real grip and trigger values for physical-release gating. It cannot fabricate a release or incidentally reopen a wheel. Reserved system buttons are not bound. In a menu, left axis navigates, Use or a freshly pressed trigger confirms, and Menu goes back. Holding a trigger across menu entry does not confirm. The selected pointing hand's trigger clicks native items; invalid hand/reference/menu/focus releases the owned mouse button and requires neutral rearming.

Comfort defaults: yaw following starts after35° relative turn and stops with8° residual error, at up to90°/s. Position following has0.35m entry/0.10m stop and0.35s easing. Panels remain level and at least1m in front; lifecycle/recenter/visibility discontinuities reseed the anchor. Menu defaults are2.2m distance/2.2m width; HUD1.5m distance/1.05m width with4:1 geometry. User settings clamp safe finite ranges. Physical size/readability/comfort were not evaluated in a headset.
