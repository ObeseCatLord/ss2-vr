# Serious Sam 2 OpenXR VR — active instructions

## Authority and scope

The user authorizes PC development, tool setup, additional sessions and online
multiplayer development. Multiplayer with other mod users is required. Preserve
Windows and Linux/Proton targets, SteamVR + Steam Frame and Envision/Monado +
Bigscreen Beyond. Beyond controller profile depends on the actual controllers.
Teleport is excluded.

Non-scoped weapons require proper per-hand laser aiming. Mixed desktop/VR
multiplayer is required when every participating player has the mod installed.
Desktop players must retain native mouse/keyboard input and rendering without
requiring a headset; VR pose admission must not suppress their native actions.

Complete native stereo world rendering, tracked head translation/rotation and
independent hands; native dual wield, per-hand weapon wheels/lasers/scopes;
comfortable threshold-follow menus/HUD; coherent roomscale/body collision;
vehicles, physical melee and multiplayer body/weapon/head presentation. Do not
substitute narrower scope or call inactive helpers completed features.

Current user authority supersedes historical root-only/no-runtime/pause and
publication-hold instructions. The user explicitly approved public source and
sanitized reverse-engineering notes for ObeseCatLord/ss2-vr. Binary/release
publication is outside that source-only approval. Historical instructions are
preserved byte-for-byte in [the archive](docs/AGENTS_HISTORY_2026_10_09.md);
use this active file and current user messages for authority.

## Workspace and ownership

Use this isolated sanitized development checkout. Preserve the old installed-game
checkout, old ancestry, rejected melee patch, user changes, installation,
settings/profiles/saves and all attempted private fixtures. Never merge/reset old
email-bearing history into this checkout. Cloud source edits stopped to avoid
competing writers. One original integration/runtime/publication owner remains.

The four reviewed parallel commits are already integrated; see
[PARALLEL_INTEGRATION](docs/PARALLEL_INTEGRATION.md). The untracked transfer handoff
is preserved coordination evidence, not a patch to apply again. Do not stage,
edit or delete it as routine source work.

Before substantive changes read current [status](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md),
[continuation](docs/CLOUD_CONTINUATION.md), relevant exact gate documents,
FINAL_PLAN.md, RESEARCH.md and MODLOG.md. Historical HANDOFF.md is not a pause
instruction. Current private handoff/actual worktree take precedence over stale
status entries. Preserve historical evidence when correcting it.

## Architecture and native boundaries

Preserve Serious Engine 2 rendering, simulation, inventory/ammo/cooldowns,
damage/projectiles, saves, AI and native physics. Keep classic D3D9 CPU readback
into the separate x64 D3D11 OpenXR host. No shared GPU-handle transport rewrite.
Prefer the smallest adapter at a demonstrated incompatibility; compare it with
any proposed parallel implementation before changing architecture.

No invented native fields/functions/offsets, fake stereo, headset-as-mouse aim,
shared weapon aim or duplicate gameplay state machines. Verify native names,
ABI/addresses and module fingerprints from actual source/owned binaries. Unknown
means unknown. Reopen designs when evidence contradicts them or new layers
multiply state/ownership policy. Rendering must not advance simulation; gameplay
mutation stays on the simulation thread.

Never activate handoff/unaccepted-melee.patch: it can throw carried objects.
Native160/348 remain manual-only. Read current melee/native gates rather than
priming Low, release or native history. Native packet counters, queue growth and
correction return alone do not prove actor-property application/ownership.

Physical driver controls require positively established model/seat/control
geometry. A road-wheel joint is not a driver's wheel. Keep exact inspected and
uninspected coverage; no guessed offsets or car wheels on unrelated mounts.
One-/two-hand grabbing must permit smooth transfer. Preserve joystick fallback,
native throttle/aim/fire/physics and original ClientAction transport. Squeeze
availability loss requires explicit release/rearm; inactive is not released.

## Current runtime authorization

The user will primarily test shooting, vehicles, hardware and multiplayer. Do not
run individual weapon-firing probes. Finish source implementation and provide a
comprehensive runnable user test procedure when ready.

The user explicitly allows necessary PRIVATE NEUTRAL captures for the
startup/idle-geometry blocker, up to six minutes per fresh sealed fixture.
No desktop input/focus, movement, firing, switching, zoom, vehicle, headset or
network probes in that exception. Startup may restore/focus only the exact owned
private SS2 window and send one guarded loading Enter down/up pair. Existing
repeated private display/prerequisite checks are also authorized. Do not ask
again for the same scope or revive exhausted historical one-capture limits.

The user additionally authorized verified save editing or cheats to create an
isolated sniper fixture after confirming no existing sniper save. This permits
private single-player grant/equip/save preparation needed for neutral ID13
collection. Verify the native route before use, preserve normal profiles/saves,
and retain the private-window/no-desktop-interference and no-firing/movement
limits. It does not authorize cheats in online sessions.

Use the reviewed isolated lab/prefix and per-process simulated Monado setup,
fixed neutral poses/zero controls, exact products/settings/profiles/scene and
source/tool seals, bounded readiness/deadlines and exact owned-process cleanup.
Attempted fixtures are immutable: never rerun/reseal, including failures.
A collection-readiness rejection after clean scene/shutdown is not a startup
crash. Keep native/Windows runtime manifests distinct and preserve global
runtime/security/credential settings. No automatic WinBoat passthrough changes.

Earlier brief game focus and simulated Monado questions were explicitly answered;
they are not pending permission questions. General online development authority
remains. Lab-only single-player initialization suppression must never become a
production multiplayer restriction.

## Verification and completion

Gameplay VR requires distinct native per-eye WORLD views, head translation and
rotation driving native cameras, correct FOV/parallax, coherent hands/origin/body
collision. Menu quads, duplicate flat gameplay or synthetic-only submission do
not satisfy it. See [runtime acceptance](docs/RUNTIME_ACCEPTANCE_MATRIX.md) and
[gameplay readiness](docs/PC_GAMEPLAY_READINESS.md).

Preserve actual native dual-wield eligibility/mechanics. User acceptance covers
per-hand identity/pose/aim, independent press/release/no stuck triggers,
simultaneous fire, switch/equip changes, native ammo/reload, per-hand scope
ownership, interruption/death/respawn and multiplayer. Hand annotations/content,
transform agreement, controller-origin/grasp semantics and physical release are
separate evidence. Never infer alignment from a root near a controller, borrow
another draw/eye's cache association or widen tolerance for a passing result.

Report implemented, built, static, simulated-runtime and actual-device evidence
separately. Keep unknown compatibility explicit. Source scaffolds, counters and
mocks are not completion. Avoid repeated exhausted broad audits; an unresolved
gate needs a concrete next source/probe operation or precise missing input.

## Builds and reviews

C++20; explicit x86 native calling conventions; pointer-free fixed-width IPC;
bounded waits; pinned dependencies/licenses. Build x86 game/server and x64
host/official loader. Rebuild ALL products after src/cmake/CMakeLists changes
before packaging. Check current compiled fingerprints and IPC10/wire7 layouts.
Pure offline-tool changes require their meaningful consumer/regression checks
and product-contract verification, not an invented native rebuild requirement.

Use the existing Python dependency environment for native verifiers/builds:
PYTHONPATH must name the checkout's deps/python by absolute path, because CTest
changes working directory; set PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1. Run appropriate checks; do not
repeat broader passing checks without a new change or unresolved concern.

Use the main agent or Terra for substantive investigation and implementation.
All delegated reviews require explicit gpt-6-astra at xhigh or a supported Astra
Max/Ultra setting; never use a fixed Terra reviewer, Sol or Spark for reviews.
Reverify effective local model/effort tags on every review turn, including reused
or resumed agents. Earlier tags do not establish current routing. If a resume
cannot explicitly select Astra, spawn a fresh gpt-6-astra/xhigh reviewer instead.
Report unavailable Astra instead of substituting models.
State independent backend-attestation limitations. Before delegation specify objective, exact scope,
read-only/disjoint write ownership, output/evidence bounds and failure path.
Workers must not revert others. Main retains architecture/integration and public
conclusions. Close completed agents; periodically inspect subagent-audit results
privately and avoid overlapping/high-fanout work. Routine deterministic preflight
checks do not require another design review when the reviewed procedure is
unchanged; verify exact bytes/paths/seals instead.

## Preservation and publication

No proprietary assets/binaries/raw disassembly, captures, credentials or sensitive
telemetry in public source. Keep analysis/captures/packages private. Stage mod
files reversibly with backups and refuse unrelated collisions. Use exact owned
PIDs; no broad process killing, destructive cleanup/reset/force-push, security or
credential change without specific user intent.

Actions stays DISABLED and workflow files ABSENT. Before each source push verify
complete raw ancestry with tools/verify_publication_history.py HEAD; all reachable
author AND committer emails must be strictly empty. Use anonymous project names
and explicit empty emails for commits; never trust publishing-tool defaults or
limit the gate to the tip/revision range. Inspect staged source/messages for
private contents separately. Preserve old email ancestry outside this repo.
